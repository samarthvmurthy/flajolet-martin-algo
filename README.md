# Flajolet-Martin Algorithm for Counting Distinct Elements

This Python script implements the Flajolet-Martin algorithm to estimate the number of distinct elements in a dataset. The algorithm utilizes random hashing and trailing zeros in the binary representation of hashed values to make probabilistic estimations.

## Project Structure

1. **`flajolet_martin.py`:**
   - The main script containing the implementation of the Flajolet-Martin algorithm.

2. **`dataset.csv`:**
   - The dataset file. Replace this file with your own dataset as needed.

3. **`README.md`:**
   - The README file providing an overview of the project and instructions on how to run the Flajolet-Martin algorithm.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the Flajolet-Martin algorithm:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flajolet-martin.git
   cd flajolet-martin
   ```

2. Ensure you have a CSV file named `dataset.csv` with the appropriate data.

3. Run the Flajolet-Martin algorithm:
   ```bash
   python flajolet_martin.py
   ```

   The script will output the estimated number of distinct elements in the dataset.

## Flajolet-Martin Algorithm

The script uses the Flajolet-Martin algorithm to estimate the number of distinct elements in the dataset. The algorithm employs random hashing and counts trailing zeros in the binary representation of hashed values to make probabilistic estimations.
